Welcome!

Open-Driving-3D is a driving simulator that I'm making in python with panda3d. I plan to at some point add AI traffic. Its fairly simple right now, but its only on version 0.05.

The reason I wanted to create a driving sim was because there don't seem to be enough free ones.

You need the Panda3d game engine to run this program.
