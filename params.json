I plan to at some point add AI traffic. Its still in early development, which means that its still pretty basic.\r\n\r\nThe reason I wanted to create a driving sim was because there don't seem to be enough free ones.\r\n\r\nYou need the Panda3d game engine to run this program, because currently there are no binaries, just the source.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* A car that you can drive around.\r\n* Three different ground textures to choose from.\r\n* You can change the time.\r\n* Interior with working steering wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Menu and car.](http://s27.postimg.org/3la3kkiyb/Screenshot_Sun_Jun_28_14_54_47_2015_421.jpg)\r\n![Inside of car.](http://s15.postimg.org/54zec0hnf/Screenshot_Sun_Jun_28_14_55_13_2015_1975.jpg)\r\n![Car parked.](http://s8.postimg.org/xrdd9t2hh/Screenshot_Sun_Jun_28_14_55_46_2015_3985.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Controls\r\n\r\nAccelerate = Up Arrow\r\n\r\nTurn Left = Left Arrow\r\n\r\nTurn Right = Right Arrow\r\n\r\nBrake = Down arrow\r\n\r\nChange View = 1, 2, 3\r\n\r\nChange gear = page up, page down\r\n\r\nTurn the car on and off = x\r\n\r\nParking brake = p\r\n\r\nReset car = backspace\r\n\r\nHooter(Horn) = enter\r\n\r\nMenu = escape\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problems\r\n\r\n[Panda3d forum topic](http://www.panda3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=17817)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Enjoy.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
